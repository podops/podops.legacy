Podops is podcast infrastructure platform that provides functionallity to automate your podcast creation workflow. It allows you to create the podcast feed and delivers media assets like mp3s or images to podcast clients. 

The platform follows an API-first approach and is very *light* on user-facing frontends. Almost all interactions with Podops happens either using `po` the command line interface or by directly integrating the Rest API.

If you need support or have ideas for improving Podops, please join the [Podops Gitter community](https://gitter.im/podops/) or visit the [GitHub Issues section](https://github.com/podops/podops/issues) of this repo. Please visit the Podops document repository for installation instructions and documentation.

## Open-source but not open-contribution?

I am grateful for community involvement, bug reports, & feature requests but I do not expect code contributions at this time. I will gladly review [pull requests](https://github.com/podops/podops/pulls) however. 

There is another way to help the project: many of the most valuable contributions are in the forms of [testing, feedback, and documentation](https://github.com/podops/podops/issues). This helps to harden the software and streamlines its usage for other users.

Should you wish to contribute, please have a look at the [contribution guidelines](/docs/contributing.md) first.
